	* Changed add_to_list_bottom, :if => :scope_changed? callback to be compatible with older active_record versions

	* scope_changed? returns false if new_record?

2008-06-16 - Sean Huber (shuber@huberry.com)
	* When a record's scope changes, a call to add_to_list_bottom is not made until the record is saved

2008-06-15 - Sean Huber (shuber@huberry.com)
	* Records do not automatically save on scope change

2008-06-15 - Sean Huber (shuber@huberry.com)
	* Records now switch lists on scope change

2008-06-09 - Sean Huber (shuber@huberry.com)
	* Updated CHANGELOG emails

2008-06-09 - Sean Huber (shuber@huberry.com)
	* Scope condition properly quotes foreign key values (e.g "parent_id = '1'")
	* Removed logic that converts scopes that are belongs_to symbols into foreign keys. This will require you to specifically pass the foreign key as a symbol now (e.g. :parent_id instead of :parent) which allows to scope to fields like :type
	* Updated documentation

2008-06-09 - Sean Huber (shuber@huberry.com)
	* Added more tests
	* Updated documentation

2008-06-09 - Sean Huber (shuber@huberry.com)
