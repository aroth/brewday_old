Community app for homebrewers.

Getting started:
  - script/reset
  
  This will run: 
    rake db:drop
    rake db:create
    rake db:seeds
    
  The app is a moving target. Rather than adding countless migrations, the existing migrations may change between commits. Running script/reset after pulling the repo and using the test users (see db/seeds.rb) is the safest practice at the moment.
